* Code that should be deployed is [here](https://github.com/ParveenBhadooOfficial/Bhadoo-Drive-Index/tree/master/worker/dist) where `worker.js` can be for small number of items and `goindex.js` is advanced and better.

## How to

* Open https://codedri.ve.workers.dev
* For Latest Version use https://gencode.ve.workers.dev
* If you want to deploy main drive leave the option ROOT as it is.
* If you want to deploy your Team Drive/Shared Drive/Folder then copy the ID and replace it with ROOT.
* Eg. if you open [this shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AOM2i7MQiuWIUk9PVA) 0AOM2i7MQiuWIUk9PVA is its ID.
* Authenticate and copy the code from Google and paste it into Authorization Code Box.
* Click on Get Code to Generate Code and Copy it for later use.
* Now Create Cloudflare account and verify email or login with existing account.
* Find Workers and Open it.
* Create your sub-domain or continue if already done.
* Select the Free Plan.

* You can rename the workers at top of the page.
* Now paste the code you copied before.
* Click on Save and Deploy.
* Done. (May take time for some users due to new account or cache issues)
